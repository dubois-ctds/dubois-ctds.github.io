The purpose of this symposium is to convene faculty and students with interest in promoting Data Science Education to experience the DUBOIS Data Science and explore the adaptability of this curriculum on their campuses. We are planning several hands-on sessions at the Symposium where participants will directly engage with the curriculum.

## Symposium Objectives

1. **Knowledge Exchange**: To foster knowledge sharing and innovations in Data Science Education for Undergraduates
1. **Community Building**: To foster community amongst Data Science educators and learners
1. **Emerging Trends**: To explore emerging trends and potential best practices and address challenges in teaching and learning Data Science on college campuses
1. **Mentorship Opportunities**: To facilitate connections between experienced Data Science educators and those newer to the field
1. **Presenting Findings**: To share advancements and methodologies in Data Science Education

Symposium activities will include a broad range of sessions, such as panels, poster presentations and time for participants to reflect on a potential for working collaboratively to advance Data Science opportunities on their campuses.

## Participants

We highly encourage participation by small interdisciplinary teams of 2-3 Faculty Members from each institution (e.g. Computer Scientists, Engineers, Mathematicians, Social and Behavioral Scientists) who have an interest in starting a Data Science curriculum on their campuses or enhancing an existing one. *We strongly encourage teams of faculty or faculty and students from the same institution to attend the Symposium.* Single Faculty participation is welcomed as well. Faculty may also bring interested students with them!
